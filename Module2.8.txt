Module 2.8

1. Discuss within your group about what the project scenario is e.g. “We are working for an ride-hailing company”.
We are working for a banking app company

2.Discuss within your group about what methodology you will use e.g. Agile/ Waterfall.
We are using the Agile Methodology, as we can push out simple features as and when we produce and improve our app whenever we create a new feature. 

3.When it comes to deployment, discuss what software deployment strategy you will use and why.
Rolling deployment is simple to roll back, less risky deployment method, and the implementation is simple. As a bank we need to ensure if anything goes wrong we can quickly roll back and keep the service up.

4.Discuss what CI/CD Pipeline tools that you will use.
We will be using Jira > Slack > Github > Jenkins >Terraform & Anisible
CI would be Jenkins and Terraform and Anisible for CD.

5.Discuss a simple pipeline that you will use and describe it on diagram.
